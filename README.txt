Small modification to the SpeedFan Info, a Kodi scipt written by Kyle Johnson: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=122481

Changes to _parse_log in default.py convert SpeedFan log reading to Fahrenheit if selected in Kodi, otherwise reading will continue to be in Celsius.

This XBMC plugin parses and displays information from the SpeedFan log. While this plugin works on any platform, SpeedFan only works on Windows, so it is optimally built for people using XBMC on Windows.

For more information and usage directions, please see:
